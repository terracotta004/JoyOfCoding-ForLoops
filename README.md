Learning Exercise: Writing Basic Loop Programs 

1. Write python code to print the following using for loops: 
 
a. 

    1 
    2 
    3 
    4 
    5 
 
b. 

    2 
    5 
    8 
    11 
 
c. 

    -10 -8 -6 -4 -2 0 

d. 

    **** 
    **** 
    **** 
    **** 
 
 
2. Write a for loop that prints the letters in “CSCI 150” on separate 
lines.

3. Using the range function, print the numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive). 
Each number should be on a separate line.

Learning Exercise: Writing Loop Word Problems 

1. Using the range function, print the multiples of 5 from 10 through 
25 (inclusive). The numbers should each be separated by a space. 
(Hint: use the end parameter to the print function like we did in 
for_range.py). Don’t forget to print a newline after this loop by 
calling print() with no parameters. 

2. Using the range function, print the multiples of 3 from -3 to 21 
(inclusive). Each number should be separated by a comma and a 
space. There should not be a comma after the final number (21). 

3. Create a program avg.py that calculates and prints the average of 
10 real (i.e., decimal) numbers entered by the user. Make sure you 
ask (i.e., prompt) the user to enter each number (the user will hit 
enter after each number).
